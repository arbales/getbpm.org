h2. Contributions

Gemcutter has a 'commit-bit' policy, much like the Rubinius project. Submit a patch that is accepted, and you can get full commit access to the project. All you have to do is ask us on #gemcutter on Freenode or bug qrush in a message and he'll add you as a collaborator on the main repository. Feel free to fork the project though and have fun in your own sandbox.

Please read up on the "GitHub Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/contribution-guidelines for the latest contribution guidelines.

To get setup, please check out the "Development Setup":https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/wiki/Development-Setup page on the wiki. It's on the wiki so anyone can edit it, so please fix it if you have trouble getting set up!

Our deployment process is documented on the wiki as well, there's a multi-step "Checklist":https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/wiki/Deployment to run through.

h2. Organization

Gemcutter consists of a few major parts:

* Rails app: To manage users and allow others to view gems, etc.
* Sinatra app (Hostess): the gem server
* Gem processor: Handles incoming gems and storing them in S3 (production) or on the filesystem in @server/@ (development).
